# Z-Inspection® Tooling
This repository contains various scripts developed to assess different steps during the assessment with Z-Inspection®.

The following is a short explanation of the scripts, in which steps of the assessment process they can be used and why they were found useful.

## Template for the meeting proceedings
To start a new assessment process, we have a meeting with stakeholders, where they tell us about the system. They give us some context on where the system is used, what problem it is intended to solve, what steps they have taken to ensure the system is solving the problem, and how the system is currently used.

We found it useful to collect a written summary of this meeting, where the information is organized according to the following structure:
1. Aim of the system  
   Goal of the system, context WHY it is used, ...
2. Actors  
   Who is using the system, who is influenced by decisions of the system, who has interest in the system being deployed, ... 
3. Actors' Expectation and Motivation  
   Why would the different groups of actors want the system? 
   What are their expectations towards the system behaviour?
   What benefits are they expecting from using the system?
4. Actors' Concerns and Worries
   What problems / challenges can the actors foresee?
   Do they have concerns regarding the use of the system?
5. Context where the AI system is used
   Additional context for the situations where the AI system is used, how it could be used in the future, ...
6. Interaction with the AI system
   What is the intended interaction between the system and its users? Why is it like this?
7. AI Technology used  
   Technical description of the AI system, so techncially inclined people can get a better intuition how it is working
8. Clinical studies
   Was the system's performance validated in (clinical) studies? 
   What were the results of these studies? 
   Are the results openly available?
9. Intellectual Property
   What IP regulations need to be considered when assessing / disseminating the system?
   Is it open access?
   Does it contain confidential information that must not be published?
10. Legal framework
    What is the legal framework for use of the system?
    What special regulations apply?

With the information organized this way, people are encouraged to go through the materials again and ask questions in the document where they need additional clarifications from the stakeholders / developers. This helps bring everyone to a shared understanding of the system and it helps the stakeholders identify where they need to provide additional information on the system.
